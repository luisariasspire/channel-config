# 
# Stops the scheduling of contacts for this FM at the specified ground
# stations to mitigate issues related to overlapping payload and contact 
# windows.
#
# We achieve this by (ab)using the no_overlapping_transits constraint
# with the norad_id/TLE set to that of the satellite that has this
# constraint. As the TLE's are the same all transits are guaranteed to
# fail this constraint and as a result no contacts will get scheduled.
