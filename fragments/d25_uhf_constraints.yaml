# Separation constraints for D25/NG-14 satellites on UHF bands.
# NASA requires that we only transmit when the ISS is not in view of our ground station.

# 
# In January 2021 this constraint was relaxed to only include five stations. Our
# initial operating agreement with DLR (the ISS tenant we are to avoid
# interference with) extends until the end of February, 2021, when we will need
# to remove the ground station mask and prevent overlapping transits with the
# ISS from all ground stations. The text is reproduced below.
#
# > As per agreement between Spire and DLR, uplink and downlink at 402.7 MHz shall
# > not use the ground stations listed below (identified by DLR as sources of high
# > interference) during the 1st 15 days after deployment from the ISS.. After the
# > 1st 15 days, MINAS uplinks and downlinks at 402.7 MHz are not allowed while
# > the ISS is in-view of any MINAS ground stations.
# > Ground stations not allowed for 402.7 MHz operations during the 1st 15 days
# > after deployment:
# > a. BDUGS, Norway
# > b. GLAGS, United Kingdom
# > c. JNBGS, South Africa
# > d. ORKGS, Ireland
# > e. SMAGS, Azores
